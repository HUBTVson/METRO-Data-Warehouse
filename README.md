# METRO-Data-Warehouse
Group project with: [Jakub Janicki](https://github.com/Jaqb-Janicqi)

“METRO” is the underground train that transports people. It
operates only one subway line. The main goal of introducing new monitoring systems to METRO is to
decrease congestion during most busy hours (running more trains)
and increase the number of users of monthly passes by 5%.
